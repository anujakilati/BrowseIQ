This subreddit was created for people to be able to ask questions about the San Francisco Bay Area to residents. We strive to have /r/askSF serve as a reference to SF Bay Area resources. Post your question about, but not limited to: visiting the city, moving to the city, nightlife, restaurants, transportation, lifestyle, culture, etc.
