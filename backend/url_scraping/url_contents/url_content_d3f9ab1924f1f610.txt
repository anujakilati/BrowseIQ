Discover a hidden gem in South San Francisco every Thursday from 5:00 - 8:00 PM and Fridays & Saturdays from 5:00 - 9:00 PM*: the Secret Wine Bar at San Francisco Wine School
.
We're wine geeks, not snobs and we love to entertain. So this year, we've decided to share our passion for fun and unique wines with our local community in a casual wine bar setting on a regular basis.
At any given time, we have hundreds of different wine selections from all nooks and crannies of the planet in our curriculum and even more in our cellar just waiting for their moment to shine. This exclusive, weekly pop-up offers an ever-changing selection of these exceptional wines, curated by Master Sommelier David Glancy. A new theme each month will include familiar grapes and regions of course, but you'll also find many you've never tried and others you've probably never even heard of. We'll also feature some rare and limited pours—available only while they last. Some good ol' classic varietals and styles as well as Low/No Alcohol options will always be available. Whether you're a wine connoisseur or just dipping your toes into the world of wine, this intimate setting is the perfect place to relax, sip, and connect.
Pair your wine with our chef’s expertly crafted Nosh Boards carefully designed to complement each theme we select. These delectable boards feature international cheeses and charcuterie, homemade dips, spreads, jams, roasted nuts, pickled veggies, and more. They're perfect for sharing (or savoring solo). Make sure to pre-order yours to ensure availability.
Each pop-up wine bar will be hosted by one of San Francisco Wine School's industry leading instructors, so it's a perfect time to ask questions about the wines or our classes, memberships, and event offerings. You can bet that Master Sommelier David Glancy, himself will be making plenty of appearances. You can also expect to be meeting some special guests throughout the year!
Love what you tasted?  Wines will be available for purchase at each event to take home. Special orders are always available as well.
Must be 21 or over.
Please RSVP here.
