Dexterity
What is Dexterity
At a high level, Dexterity is a smart contract (or collection of smart contracts) that allow for the creation of a decentralized exchange on the Solana blockchain. The modular design of these contracts allows operators to create generic instruments with customizable risk and fee models.
To Deploy
In order to deploy Dexterity, you will need to modify the mock keys in
master_program_config.json
to match the target program IDs. The build script will automatically fill in the keys into the program files.
If you would like to use the
deploy_all.sh
script. Paste the upgrade authority keypair for each of these contracts into the file
~/.config/solana/dexterity_shared.json
. Be sure to not commit this file.
Build and Run Tests
Requirements:
rust nightly
solana clis
[Optional] solana-test-validator
First, install poetry for the python client (only needed the first time around):
cd
client
poetry install
Then build and test the protocol
git submodule init
git submodule update
./build.sh
./test.sh
Note that if you use the
--replace
option in the
build.sh
script, you will need to explicitly call
cargo build-bpf
in the root directory to seed the target folder with program keypair files.
