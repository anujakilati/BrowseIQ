Frequently Asked Questions
What is eSIM?
An eSIM is a digital SIM that eliminates the need for a physical SIM card. With eSIM, you can quickly and easily transfer an existing cellular plan or get a new cellular plan, all digitally. You can even store multiple eSIMs on the same device and use two phone numbers at the same time. And it’s more secure — someone can’t remove the physical SIM card if your iPhone is lost or stolen. In just a few simple steps, you are ready to make calls, send messages, and browse the web.
Learn more about eSIM.
(Opens in a new window)
Use of eSIM requires a wireless service plan. Not all carriers support eSIM. Use of eSIM in iPhone may be disabled when purchased from some carriers. Check with your carrier for details and restrictions.
Learn more about eSIM and carriers.
(Opens in a new window)
Can I activate an iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, or iPhone 16 Pro outside of the United States?
iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, and iPhone 16 Pro models purchased in the U.S. or Puerto Rico don’t have a physical SIM tray and activate only using eSIM. You can activate your iPhone outside the country if your carrier supports eSIM.
Learn more about using eSIM while traveling.
(Opens in a new window)
Will my new iPhone be unlocked?
In most cases, yes. An iPhone purchased from
apple.com
(Opens in a new window)
is unlocked. Once your new iPhone is activated, it remains unlocked, which means you can use it with any network that provides service for iPhone. There are two exceptions: If you buy an iPhone with an AT&T Installment Plan, your iPhone will be locked to AT&T and will only work on the AT&T network for the term of your Installment Plan agreement. If you buy an iPhone through Boost Mobile Financing, it will be locked to Boost Mobile for the first 60 days after activation.
When I buy from apple.com, does my iPhone come ready to use?
Carrier-connected iPhone 15, iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, and iPhone 16 Pro models will arrive ready to activate with eSIM and can connect to your cellular voice and data service without a physical SIM card.
If you completed the steps to authorize activation with AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon when you purchased your new iPhone online, it will arrive ready to use. Just turn it on and follow the onscreen instructions to set it up and activate with the carrier. To activate with eSIM, you will need Wi-Fi for setup.
If you choose “Connect to a carrier later” when you buy your iPhone, you can activate with your service when you receive your device. If you’re asked to transfer your SIM, follow the onscreen instructions to transfer service from your previous iPhone. To learn more, visit
support.apple.com/kb/HT212780
(Opens in a new window)
.
Will my iPhone work worldwide?
All iPhone models are world phones, so you can use them almost anywhere. Whether you are a GSM or CDMA network customer, you can roam internationally on GSM networks in over 200 countries or regions around the world. If you financed your iPhone with your wireless carrier, contact them to verify that you can roam internationally.
Availability of 5G and LTE data varies in some countries or regions and depends on carrier support for certain 5G and LTE radio frequencies. Contact your wireless carrier for more information regarding international roaming policies and rates.

I’m buying an iPhone as a gift. Can it be activated at a later date?
In most cases, an iPhone purchased from apple.com can be activated later. However, certain special deals or discounts may require preparation with the carrier at the time of purchase so that the phone arrives ready to use.
Is it easy to transfer my data and set up my new iPhone?
Yes, iCloud makes moving your settings, photos, apps, and documents to a new device seamless. Just sign in to iCloud when you set up your new device, access your previous device’s iCloud backup, and you’ll be ready to go in minutes.
Don’t have enough iCloud storage to complete a backup? iCloud will grant you enough temporary storage to make sure you can back up your device and get all your data transferred, free of charge (iOS 15 required).
With Quick Start, you can restore your data and content to your new iPhone from your iCloud backup. For phones using iOS 12.4 or later, Quick Start offers the option of using device-to-device migration, allowing you to transfer all your data wirelessly from your current device to your new one.
If you are switching from Android, you need to download the Move to iOS app first and follow the setup process on your new iPhone.
To learn how to transfer data to your new iPhone, see
support.apple.com/en-us/HT201269
.

Are there differences between an iPhone for AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, or Verizon?
The iPhone models for AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, and Verizon are the same. If you choose to pay with an AT&T Installment Plan, your iPhone will be locked to the carrier. If you pay with Boost Mobile Financing, it will be locked to the carrier for the first 60 days. For details on network support, please see

How does the iPhone Upgrade Program work?
The iPhone Upgrade Program is the easiest way to upgrade to a new iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro, and it also offers the security and protection of AppleCare+. Learn more about joining the
iPhone Upgrade Program
(Opens in a new window)
.
If you are already part of the program, start by checking your upgrade status to see if you’re eligible for a new iPhone. If you are, you can either proceed with your upgrade online or visit an Apple Store and chat with a Specialist. You can upgrade anytime after six months, as long as you’ve made the equivalent of at least 12 payments. If you have to pay an additional amount to meet your 12 payments, you can do it when you upgrade. We will arrange for you to trade in your old iPhone as part of the program, so please do not trade in your current iPhone using the standard
Apple Trade In option

What are connectivity discounts?
Connectivity discounts are reflected in the advertised price of select iPhone models, and are available to customers who connect with select carriers at the time of purchase. The discount is not available for customers who choose to connect to a carrier later.
Which network providers offer 5G service?
AT&T, Boost Mobile, T-Mobile, and Verizon are the national wireless carriers for iPhone in the United States, and they all offer 5G service. iPhone 15, iPhone 16e, iPhone 16, and iPhone 16 Pro are 5G capable. The Apple Store and

You’ll need to select AT&T, Boost Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you checkout. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time, subject to your carrier’s terms. Taxes and shipping on items purchased using ACMI are subject to your card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at special storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths and eligible products. See the
Apple Card Customer Agreement

The display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 6.06 inches (iPhone 16e), 6.12 inches (iPhone 15, iPhone 16), 6.27 inches (iPhone 16 Pro), 6.69 inches (iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 16 Plus), or 6.86 inches (iPhone 16 Pro Max) diagonally. Actual viewable area is less.
Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 12GB to 24GB of space, including iOS 18 with its latest features and Apple apps that can be deleted. Apple Intelligence on‑device models can be deleted if Apple Intelligence is turned off and use approximately 7GB of space. Turning on Apple Intelligence will download the models again.
