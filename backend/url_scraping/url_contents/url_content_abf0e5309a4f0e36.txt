Loved by
world-class devs
Engineers all around the world reach for Cursor by choice.
Cursor is at least a 2x improvement over Copilot.
It's amazing having an AI pair programmer, and is an incredible accelerator for me and my team.

The Cursor tab completion while coding is occasionally so magic it defies reality - about ~25% of the time it is anticipating exactly what I want to do.
It is enough to make you believe that eventually you'll be able to code at the speed of thought.

Cursor is hands down my biggest workflow improvement in years

I love writing code and Cursor is a necessity. Cursor is steps ahead of my brain, proposing multi-line edits so I type 'tab' more than anything else.

Cursor is so good, and literally gets better/more feature-rich every couple of weeks.

Cursor is awesome!
Someone finally put GPT into a code editor in a seamless way. It's so elegant and easy. No more copying and pasting. I'm an hour in and already hooked.

Cursor is the best AI developer tool right now, avoid it at your own peril

Started using Cursor yesterday & i'm blown away. it's how Copilot should feel. i'm completely off VSCode now.

Cursor is the best product I've used in a while - it's an AI enabled editor.
I just asked it to write a README for a project I've been working on - analyzed the code-base and worked first time.

Cursor's new auto-complete is insane
You no longer need to prompt it. It predicts what code you want based on what you're doing. Accept by hitting tab
In this video I change the CSS class of one link. I then simply keep hitting tab to make the same change to all other links

I really like how Cursor suggests edits to existing code. It noticed I was inconsistent with my markup and popped up this suggestion that matched my other items!

The most useful AI tool that I currently pay for is, hands down, is Cursor
It's fast, autocompletes when and where you need it to, handles brackets properly, sensible keyboard shortcuts, bring- your-own-model...everything is well put together.

I went from never hearing about Cursor to many IC engineers telling me it's their new favorite tool. Seemingly overnight! Pretty wild product-market fit.

I installed Cursor

After many recommendations, I finally switched from VSC to Cursor and ... wow!
It's absolutely incredible. If you like Copilot (or if you don't), you'll be blown away by Cursor.

Cursor has changed the game. I really can't imagine writing code without it at this point. The switch from VSCode is easy, and now I have AI superpowers right in my editor and my terminal.
